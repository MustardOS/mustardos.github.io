# <strong>The Grand Tour</strong>

Your complete guide to every part of the current MustardOS release. From the familiar **Main Menu** to the deep reaches
of advanced settings to system information, and everything in between (_and maybe a secret or two_), this tour will
take you through every module, menu, and setting that makes MustardOS both powerful, customisable, and configurable.

Each stop along the way opens a new area to explore with helpful detailed explanations, glyph references, and some
general use tips. Whether you are just getting started or already know your way around, you are bound to discover
something new.
