    This is an <strong>Archive Manager</strong> installable archive for those who are running the following previous
    MustardOS releases. <em>Install on any other version at your own risk.</em>

      <li><strong>2601.0</strong> Jacaranda</li>
    </ul>

note:
  - Themes are now stored as open folders instead of compressed archives (previously extracted to the <code>active</code> folder).
    This enables faster theme switching, alternate theme changes, and restores random theme selection on device start.
    Existing <code>.muxthm</code> theme files in <code>MUOS/theme</code> must be extracted manually.
