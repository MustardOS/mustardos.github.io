  warning:
    - Please make sure that you have either migrated your data to SD2 or have used the Device Backup feature and copied your backup archive(s).

note:
  - Themes are now stored as open folders instead of compressed archives (previously extracted to the <code>active</code> folder). 
    This enables faster theme switching, alternate theme changes, and restores random theme selection on device start.
    Existing <code>.muxthm</code> theme files in <code>MUOS/theme</code> must be extracted manually.
