important:
  - Themes are now stored as open folders instead of compressed archives (previously extracted to the
    <code>active</code> folder). This enables faster theme switching, alternate theme changes, and restores random
    theme selection on device start. Existing <code>.muxthm</code> theme files in <code>MUOS/theme</code> must be
    extracted manually or via the <strong>Task Toolkit</strong> script on-device. Updating will reset your theme to
    the default MustardOS theme <strong>and boot image</strong>. Be sure to back up your current theme and boot logo
    before updating.
