  important:
    - This is a simple <strong>Archive Manager</strong> installable patch for those of you who are running either the
      MustardOS <strong>2508.1 Canada Goose</strong> or <strong>2508.2 Silly Goose</strong> versions. However you can
      download the full image for a reflash.

note:
  - Due to the amount of issues in the past relating to people changing their RetroArch global configuration
    we have opted to freeze it. If you would like to know how to unfreeze it please see the following 
    <a href="https://community.muos.dev/t/my-retroarch-configuration-is-being-repressed/823">FAQ</a> page.
  - Please ensure you read the handy hotkeys on the front page (<a href="https://muos.dev">https://muos.dev</a>) as 
    there are a few changes that have been made. Including the change from <strong>POWER</strong> to 
    <strong>START</strong> for the charging module along with the screenshot and DPAD swap hotkey changes.
