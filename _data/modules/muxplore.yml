  The Content Explorer is where all playable and viewable content is displayed. It automatically merges all mounted 
  storage devices and presents folders and content in an organised way. Each item includes visual indicators showing 
  whether it has been played before, is part of a collection, or is ready for launch through an assigned core.

  - name: Content Folder
    icon: folder
    link: muxoption
    desc: >
      Displays folders containing compatible content. MustardOS does not enforce strict naming conventions, 
      allowing you to name and structure your folders however you prefer, including nested folders for organisation.
  - name: Content File
    icon: rom
    link: muxoption
    desc: >
      Represents an individual content file, such as a game or media item. Files are automatically launched with their
      assigned system or emulator core, or you will be prompted to select one if no association exists.
  - name: Previously Played (History)
    icon: history
    link: muxoption
    desc: >
      Indicates content that has been launched before. This helps you quickly identify items with existing play 
      history for easy access or relaunching.
  - name: In Collection
    icon: collection
    link: muxoption
    desc: >
      Marked content that has been added to one or more collections. These items remain accessible in both their 
      original folder and any collection they belong to. This can be toggled in Interface Settings.
