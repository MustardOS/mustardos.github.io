      Some devices come with a secondary storage option allowing you to use it for both content and MustardOS settings.

      If a device has a USB connection you may be able to mount it via the storage mount Task Toolkit scripts.

      Internal storage, <em>or the RootFS as we call it</em>, is where most important data is held. It is always 
      a good idea to keep a watch on this as a typically full system storage may cause issues.
