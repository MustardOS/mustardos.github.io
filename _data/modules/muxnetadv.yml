  The Network Settings module provides fine control over how the system handles wireless and wired network connections 
  during startup, compatibility checks, and recovery. These options are primarily useful for troubleshooting various
  network issues, managing module loading behaviour, and improving reliability across different hardware configurations.

visible:
  - name: Connection Monitor
    icon: monitor
    desc: >
      Enables periodic connectivity checks and automatically triggers reconnection if the network connection is lost. 
      Useful for maintaining stable connections in environments with inconsistent Wi-Fi signal strength.
  - name: Start Network on Boot
    icon: boot
    desc: >
      Automatically starts the network connection during system boot. This ensures connectivity is available as soon 
      as the device powers on without requiring manual activation.
  - name: Start Network on Wake
    icon: wake
    desc: >
      Re-connects the Wi-Fi network connection after the device resumes from sleep. Useful for ensuring background 
      services and online features reconnect automatically after waking.
  - name: Module Compatibility
    icon: compat
    desc: >
      Enables compatibility mode for network module loading through the Linux kernel. This improves support for 
      certain Wi-Fi chipsets but can moderately increase boot times.
  - name: Module Async Load
    icon: asyncload
    desc: >
      Loads compatible network modules asynchronously in the background. This option significantly reduces boot 
      times when Module Compatibility is enabled and should only be disabled if troubleshooting connection failures.
  - name: Module Wait Time
    icon: wait
    desc: >
      Sets the maximum time the system will wait for the network interface to appear during boot. Increasing this value 
      may improve stability on slower devices but will extend startup time. Avoid adjusting if Module Compatibility is 
      already enabled, as both delays will compound.
  - name: Module Retry
    icon: retry
    desc: >
      Determines how many times the system will attempt to load the network module when using Module Compatibility mode. 
      Increasing this value can help with unstable or delayed network drivers, but may extend overall boot duration.
