  Reserved for the bravest of tinkerers, this section provides direct access to low level system controls that affect 
  storage behaviour, power suspension, and process scheduling. These settings are powerful but risky.<br><br>Altering 
  them without a clear understanding can impact stability, performance, or data integrity. Adjust only if you know 
  what you are doing or if you like a bit of excitement in your life.

visible:
  - name: Swap Tendency
    icon: vmswap
    desc: >
      Controls how aggressively the system moves inactive memory pages to swap storage. Lower values keep data 
      in RAM longer, improving performance at the cost of higher memory use.
  - name: Write Back Threshold
    icon: dirty-ratio
    desc: >
      Defines the percentage of system memory that can contain unwritten (dirty) data before the kernel forces 
      it to be written to disk. Higher values delay writes but risk larger bursts of I/O.
  - name: Background Write Back
    icon: dirty-back
    desc: >
      Sets the memory percentage that triggers background write-back activity. Lower values reduce latency by 
      keeping storage more up-to-date but may increase write frequency.
  - name: Cache Reclamation
    icon: cache
    desc: >
      Determines how aggressively the kernel reclaims cached file data. Higher values free cache space quickly, 
      while lower values improve access times for frequently used files.
  - name: I/O Merge Policy
    icon: merge
    desc: >
      Configures how the kernel merges adjacent I/O requests into single operations. Disabling merges may 
      improve responsiveness on flash storage with low latency.
  - name: Queue Depth
    icon: requests
    desc: >
      Sets the maximum number of pending I/O operations allowed per device. Higher values increase throughput for 
      heavy workloads but also raise memory usage.
  - name: Read Ahead Size
    icon: readahead
    desc: >
      Specifies how much data the kernel preloads before an application requests it. Larger read-ahead values 
      benefit sequential reads, while smaller ones suit random access patterns.
  - name: Swap Read-Ahead
    icon: cluster
    desc: >
      Defines how many memory pages are prefetched from swap during reads. Lower values reduce latency; higher 
      values improve performance for sustained swap activity.
  - name: Realtime Timeslice
    icon: timeslice
    desc: >
      Determines how long real time tasks can run before being rescheduled. Lower values enhance responsiveness, 
      while higher values favour long, continuous processing.
  - name: I/O Stats
    icon: iostats
    desc: >
      Enables or disables kernel level tracking of per-device I/O statistics. Disabling this feature can slightly 
      improve performance by reducing overhead.
  - name: Idle Flush Mode
    icon: idleflush
    desc: >
      When enabled, the system flushes dirty data during idle periods instead of waiting for write thresholds. 
      Useful for flash storage and reducing power draw while inactive.
  - name: Fork Optimisation
    icon: child
    desc: >
      Prioritises newly created (forked) processes to run before their parent. Can improve perceived load times 
      in some applications.
  - name: Scheduler Scaling
    icon: tunescale
    desc: >
      Adjusts kernel scheduler behaviour dynamically based on CPU core count. Disabling this keeps tuning 
      consistent across multi-core and single-core systems.
  - name: Disk Tuning
    icon: cardmode
    desc: >
      Switches between predefined disk or card performance profiles. Useful for optimising behaviour on 
      specific SD cards or external storage.
  - name: Suspend Power State
    icon: state
    desc: >
      Changes how the system enters and resumes from sleep mode. Different suspend states balance between 
      faster wake-up and lower idle power consumption.
