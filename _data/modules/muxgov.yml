  Assign a specific CPU governor to individual content. A CPU governor controls how the processor adjusts its 
  frequency in response to workload, balancing performance, power consumption, and heat output. The selected governor 
  is change when the content is launched, then restores the system default once it exits.<br><br>These options are 
  derived from the standard Linux CPU frequency scaling subsystem and availability may vary depending on your device.
  <br><br>For more information please see the <a href="https://community.muos.dev/t/cpu-governors-and-how-do-they-work/262">CPU Governors and How Do They Work</a> FAQ page.

      Dynamically scales CPU speed based on system load. Provides a strong balance between performance and efficiency.
      Ideal for most games and applications.
  - name: Performance

      Locks the CPU to its highest possible frequency. Ensures maximum performance at the cost of higher power 
      draw and increased heat.
  - name: Powersave

      Keeps the CPU fixed at its lowest possible frequency. Great for conserving battery life or reducing heat 
      during light workloads.
  - name: Conservative

      Similar to **Ondemand** but changes frequency more gradually, avoiding sudden spikes or drops. Provides 
      smoother performance transitions at slightly lower responsiveness.

      Ramps CPU frequency up quickly when activity is detected. Favourable for input heavy applications but can 
      cause sudden power spikes on slower hardware.
  - name: Schedutil

      Integrates with the Linux scheduler to make real time frequency decisions based on task priority. Offers the 
      best overall balance on newer multi core devices.
  - name: Userspace
    icon: userspace
    desc: >
      Enables manual control of CPU speed through system tools like SSH or ADB. Intended for advanced users who want 
      precise frequency tuning.
