  - name: Menu Acceleration
    icon: accelerate
    desc: >
      Adjusts how quickly menu navigation accelerates when holding down directional buttons. Higher values make 
      scrolling faster, while lower values provide more precise control.
  - name: Menu Repeat Delay

      Determines how long a button must be held before it begins repeating its action. Increasing this delay can help 
      prevent accidental repeated inputs when navigating menus.
  - name: Battery Offset
    icon: offset

      Applies a correction value to the displayed battery percentage. Useful for calibrating the battery indicator 
      if readings are consistently higher or lower than expected.
  - name: Button Swap
    icon: swap

    desc: >
      Sets the default system volume level each time the device starts. Useful for ensuring consistent audio 
      behaviour after reboots.
  - name: Brightness On Boot
    icon: brightness
    desc: >
      Defines the display brightness applied automatically when the system starts. Adjust this to maintain a 
      comfortable default viewing level on every boot.
  - name: Thermal Zone Control
    icon: thermal
    desc: >
      Toggles automatic thermal protection that safely powers down the device when overheating. Disabling this is not

      RetroAchievements that require online access before launch.
  - name: RetroArch Config Freedom
    icon: retrofree
    desc: >
      Removes system enforced configuration restrictions on RetroArch. Allows advanced users to manually customise 
      RetroArch behaviour, but may cause instability if misconfigured.
  - name: Device Rumble

    desc: >
      Extends maximum system audio output from 100% to 200%, providing additional loudness when required. Use 
      carefully, as excessive volume may cause speaker distortion or hardware strain.
  - name: Device Lid Switch
    icon: lidswitch
    desc: >
      Enables automatic sleep functionality when closing or opening a physical lid switch, if supported by the device.
  - name: Display Suspend

      correctly if this setting is enabled, so use with caution.
  - name: System Swapfile
    icon: swapfile
    desc: >
      Configures the system’s swapfile usage, allowing limited expansion of virtual memory. Useful for memory 
      intensive content or testing system performance under load.
  - name: Secondary Partition
    icon: secondpart

      Specifies which partition number the system should mount when accessing secondary storage. Typically used for 
      advanced configurations or multi partitioned mSD cards.
  - name: External Partition
    icon: usbpart
    desc: >
      Sets the partition number used when mounting external USB storage devices. Adjust this if the system fails to 
      detect or mount certain external drives correctly.
  - name: Brightness Increment
    icon: incbright
    desc: >
      Defines how much the screen brightness changes per adjustment step. Smaller increments provide finer control, 
      while larger ones allow quicker adjustments.
  - name: Volume Increment
    icon: incvolume
    desc: >
      Adjusts how much the volume level changes per input step. Ideal for tuning audio to your specific preference.
