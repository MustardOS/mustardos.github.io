# Themes
On muOS, you can fully customise the look of your menus on your device! This is achieved with **Themes**. You can make your own themes by following the help pages here, or install some pre-existing ones below. Happy theme-ing!

# Theme Library
Currently the Theme Repo is undertaking an overhaul, however you can still access themes shared by the community via the discord below.

- [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/muos). All these themes were made by members of the muOS community. Join the community today!
