# Themes
On muOS, you can fully customise the look of your menus on your device! This is achieved with **Themes**. 
You can make your own themes by following the help pages here, or install some pre-existing ones below. Happy theme-ing!

# Theme Library

All these themes were made by members of the muOS community. Join the community today!

- You can find all themes for muOS [here](https://theme.muos.dev/).  Click on a theme title to download a `.muxthm` file. Place that file on your device within `MUOS/theme`.
- Additional themes can be found on the [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/muos).

> *Some themes have matching folder artwork whilst navigating Explore Content, this is installed separately from themes. To see if a theme has these available, navigate to the specific theme's release page on the [muOS Discord server](https://discord.gg/muos).*
