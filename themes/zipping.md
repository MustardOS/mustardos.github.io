# Creating a Preview Image

Most preview images are displayed at 45% the screen resolution. Create your preview image by taking a screenshot on your device (MENU +
PWR), or generating an image you think best represents your theme. Resize it and **rename it to preview.png**, and drop
it into your theme's resolution folder before zipping it up.

# Zipping your Theme

To zip your theme correctly, you must compress the folder structure together **NOT** the root folder of your theme.

- Select `credits.txt`, `./640x480/preview.png`, `./images/`, `./scheme/`, and the rest of your folders for your theme together.
- Use a program such as WinRar (Windows), Keka (macOS), and 7zip (Linux/Windows) to compress those as one zip.
- Name your zip whatever you choose.
- Replace the zip extension with `muxthm`, example: `theme_name.muxthm`

And you're done! Enjoy your theme on your device.
