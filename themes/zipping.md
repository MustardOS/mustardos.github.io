# Creating a Preview Image 
Most preview images are 288x216 resolution. Create your preview image by taking a screenshot on your device (MENU + PWR), or generating an image you think best represents your theme. Resize it and **rename it to preview.png**, and drop it into your theme's folder before zipping it up.

> *Be warned: the preview image resolution will take up as much space on the screen as the size of the image itself. The typical screen for muOS is 640x480, so if you use a screenshot without resizing your image, your preview within Theme Picker will cover all of your options!*

# Zipping your Theme 
To zip your theme correctly, you must compress the folder structure together **NOT** the root folder of your theme.
- Select `credits.txt`, `preview.png`, `./images/`, `./scheme/`, and the rest of your folders for your theme together.
- Use a program such as WinRar (Windows), Keka (macOS), and 7zip (Linux/Windows) to compress those as one zip.
- Name your zip whatever you choose.
- Replace the zip extension with muxthm, example: `theme_name.muxthm`

And you're done! Enjoy your theme on your device.
