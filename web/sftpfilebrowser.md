## How to use SFTP + FileBrowser

## General Idea
The guide will help you to turn on and use the built in Filebrowser accessed by your favourite browser (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

In this guide we will be navigating with some basic assumptions

* You know how to fundamentally use your browser and OS of choice
* You understand this must be done on a local network, E.g. a home network where both devices are on the same subnet, for example 192.168.1.x
* You are already connected to your Wi-Fi network of choice

## Steps

### 1 Turn on your device and navigate to Configuration

Ensure your Wi-Fi is already connected, and note the IP, this may or may not match the examples shown.

Select Webservices, then enabled "SFTP + Filebrowser"

On your PC, navigate to <Ip Address>:9090


## 2 Login to the Web Interface and Basic Navigation

Important to note, the default username/password is 

USERNAME: muos
PASSWORD: muos

When logged in, you will see basic file structure.

MUX: Internal, unlikely to touch this folder.
MMC: SD1, this can contain all your saves, roms, configurations.
SDCARD: SD2, if it has been inserted, this is another storage location (and preferred for integrity reasons)
USB: Externally connected devices
