## RetroArch Configuration Priority
RetroArch applies configurations in the following order  
- Load Global Config - `MUOS/retroarch/retroarch.cfg`
- Apply Core Overrides - `MUOS/info/config/<corename>/<corename>.cfg` - `<corename>.rmp`
- Apply Content Directory Overrides - `MUOS/info/config/<corename>/<directoryname>.cfg` - `<directoryname>.rmp`
- Apply Game Overrides - `MUOS/info/config/<corename>/<gamename>.cfg` - `<gamename>.rmp`


## Modifying RetroArch Settings
### Global Settings
This is only for changes to the RetroArch configuration that wish to apply to apply all games.  
From the muOS MAIN MENU, choose Launch RetroArch.  
All global settings can be found by entering the **Settings** menu item from this screen.  
To save any changes, return to the RetroArch **Main Menu**.  
Select **Configuration File**. Select **Save Current Configuration**

### Core, Directory, and Game Overrides
{: .note}
> These settings can only be modified once a game is loaded.

Once the game has started press the MENU button to open RetroArch.  
By default it opens into the **Quick Menu**, you may need to go back a level if you wish to access the **Settings** option used earlier.  
To save any changes you will need to go back to the **Quick Menu** and select **Overrides**.  
From here you can choose to save your changes as Game, Content Directory, or Core override.

### Other Configuration Options
There are some settings in RetroArch that are not covered by the Global and Override configurations.  
These are Remaps, Core Options, and Shaders.  Much like Overrides, these can only be modified once a game is loaded.  
In the RetroArch **Quick Menu** you can modify these and save their files.

### Remaps

Make any changes then select Manage Remap Files.  Here you can choose to save changes as Game, Content Directory, or Core remap.

### Core Options

Make any changes then select Manage Core Options.  Here you can choose to save changes as Game or Content Directory.
