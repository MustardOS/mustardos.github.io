## About

What began as a small personal hobby project has since grown into something far greater than I could have ever
imagined. Over time, it has developed into a thriving community of passionate people who share the same love for games,
tinkering, and discovery. I am deeply grateful for the support, feedback, and enthusiasm that has helped shape this
project into what it is today.

MustardOS is built around a simple philosophy: keep things easy, intuitive, and enjoyable. At its core, it exists to let
you jump straight into playing your favourite games with minimal setup, removing the complexity so you can focus on what
matters mostâ€”having fun.

Our hope is that this custom firmware not only enhances your handheld experience, but also brings you as much joy as
we've had creating and refining it.

## Features

One of the defining qualities of MustardOS is just how effortless it is to get started. Installation is straightforward
and familiar: just like with other custom firmwares, you use your preferred image flashing tool to write MustardOS onto
an SD Card.

From there, the process is seamless. Insert the SD Card into your handheld, power it on, and the system takes care of
the rest. No complicated setup. No confusing steps. Just a smooth and ready-to-play experience right from the first
boot.

Whether you're new to handhelds or a seasoned enthusiast, MustardOS is designed to get you playing quickly while still
offering plenty of depth and customisation for those who enjoy exploring further.
