## Important - PLEASE READ

{: .highlight }
> Due to recent changes with firmware this release has to unfortunately be a full-image release and not a simple update.
> This contains a partition layout change along with a few internal backend changes which helps bring simple changes for
> development purposes and closer to support smaller patches and possible OTA updates in the near future.
>
> Apologies to those who dislike re-flashing their device constantly, however with this update which includes the new
> storage preference module this should no longer be a hassle to update to full images in the future!

{: .note }
> Please read our guide to help upgrade or migrate your data from a previous version.
> This can be found in the HELP section on the sidebar.

{: .warning }
> The RetroArch configuration structure has changed to allow RetroArch settings to be shared across devices. Manually
> copying a `retroarch.cfg` file from an older release to a device running Banana may break your controls, hotkeys, etc.
> (If this happens, use the "Restore RetroArch Configuration" script in Task Toolkit to revert to defaults.)
