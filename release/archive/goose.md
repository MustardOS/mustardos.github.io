## Fun Facts

* There are over **600** changes with **21** contributors
* This release took over **6 months** of hard work and dedication
* Rotated screens are still **annoying** as ever
* Compiling specific emulators _still_ suck...
* The goose is a highly social animal and is often seen in large groups known as flocks or gaggles. They have a strong
  sense of community and rely on their flock for protection, foraging, and navigation during migration. They communicate
  with each other through a variety of vocalizations, including honking and hissing sounds.
